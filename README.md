# Augmedix and its uses to make the healthcare field more aproachable to consumers.

## **Overview and Origin**

* The name of the company is Augmedix, and it uses ambient AI technology inorder to automatically convert patient doctor conversations into medical documents.

* Augmedix was founded in 2013 however their AI advisory council was put in place in 2023.

* The founder of the company is [Ian Shakil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishakil/).

* The mission of the company is to 
>"Help clinitians and patients form a human connection at the point of care without the intrusion of technology."

* Augmedix has two main investors HCA Healthcare Inc, one of the nations leading healthcare providers, and Redmile Group, an institutional healthcare investor, in 2023 Augmedix received $12 million in new capital to advance the development of their AI tools.

## **Business Activities**

* This company is attempting to improve the ease of documentation and provide physicians and nurses more time to spend with patients. 

* The company's goal is to be implemented in as many medical specialties. As of now there are 35+ specialties supported including: Healthcare systems, Medical Offices, Hospitals, Emergency Departments, Surgury Centers, Home VIsits, Urgent Care CLinics, Telemedicine, pop-up clinics, nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities.

* Since Augmedix was a medical documentation company before implementing AI a lot of their tools such as Augmedix prep, are already widley used in the medical field allowing for the implementation of their AI tool to be more seamless to its competitors.

* Augmedix is using Generative ambient AI in order to acheive its goals of the automation of medical documentation. They have partnered with Google Cloud in order to aid both the development and implementation of their AI model

## **Landscape**

* Augmedix is in the medical field

* While the medical field has seen tremedous advancements in technology used over the last ten years the administrative side of the field is still very far behind with these tasks getting in the way of doctors seeing as many patients as possible, with the addition of AI in order to make these administrative tasks easier on the provider it will allow them to see more patients overall improving the experience for both patient and provider.

* Other major companies in this field that are implementing AI are DeepScribe and DeepCura

## **Results**

* In hospitals and health system some of the impacts seen by this technology are: improved clinical retentian, an increase in revenue due to seeing 2-3 more patients per day. In physicians and group practices they have restored clinician and patient connection, and decreased physician burnout by giving back up to 3 hours per day.

* Some metrics Augmedix uses to measure succses is how many additional patients a provider can see as well as hours of administrative work a provider must go through when using their product. on both of these metrics the company is exceeding their goals.

* Many of Augmedix's competitors are startups and seeing that Augmedix is currently being used by many leading providers they have an edge on their competitors due to the ease of implementation of their AI tool.

## **Recommendations**

* I beleive that a very useful interface for this AI tool would be a mobile app. Since this company is already using Google CLoud in order to expedite the sharing of documents the implementation of the app in order to give both providers and patients real time access to these documents.

* I think this providing this service would benifit the company on both the client and provider side. It would aid providers by offereing ease of access to the necesarry medical documents as well as providing patients with a sense of security in seeing these documents generated and where they are being sent/stored.

* The technology that this would use is mostly mobile app design in order to provide smartphone integration.

* These technologies are appropriate because one of the core metrics of Augmedix is time reduction and the implementation of this technology would further reduce the time providers use on administrative tasks by making them easier to accsess and share.
